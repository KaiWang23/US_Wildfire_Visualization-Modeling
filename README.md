# US Wildfire Visualization&Modeling

This project uses data from a Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires) containing 24-year of geo-referenced US wildfire occurences. We utilized this dataset to create a ShinyApp dashboard to visualize wildfire on national level. Then, we grouped data by states and trained servel models(LASSO, decision tree, random forest), and predicted what caused a wildfire based on location and other inputs we have. We hope given the cause of a wildfire, fire department could have an optimal strategy for eliminating the fire.
